# Master of Mathematics Thesis: Stokes System Obstacle Inversion via Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation for the Master's thesis that explores the intersection of the Stokes system obstacle inverse problem and artificial neural networks. The goal is to develop algorithms for reconstructing obstacles in viscous fluids using deep learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `obstacle-generator/dom_generator.m`: Contains MATLAB scripts for generating random obstacles.
- `data-generator/data_gen.edp`: Includes FreeFEM scripts for simulating fluid dynamics around the generated obstacles.
- `deep-learning-model/Training and Evaluation.ipynb`: Python code for the neural network model, including training and evaluation notebook.

## Research and Methodology
This project employs a combination of classical fluid dynamics and modern deep learning techniques. The methodology involves generating diverse obstacle shapes, simulating fluid flow using the Stokes system in FreeFEM, and employing neural networks for the inverse problem of obstacle reconstruction.

For more details on the research and methodology, refer to the thesis document available in the repository.
